Kashmiri Shaivism, a non-dualistic branch of Shaiva-Shakta Tantra Hinduism, offers a profound understanding of energy as it relates to the human body and consciousness. This spiritual tradition, which originated in the region of Kashmir, is known for its comprehensive exploration of the universe through the lens of consciousness and energy.

At the heart of Kashmiri Shaivism lies the concept of universal Consciousness, or Shiva, which manifests as both the individual and the cosmos. This Consciousness is not static; it is dynamic and expressed as energy, or Shakti. Shakti, in this context, is the creative, sustaining, and destructive force that flows through the universe and is inseparable from Shiva.

The human body, according to Kashmiri Shaivism, is a microcosm of the universe, containing points of energy known as chakras. These chakras are convergence points for the flow of energy and are crucial for maintaining physical and spiritual health. The practice of meditating on these energy centers can lead to a state of non-dualistic awareness, where the distinction between the individual and the universal Consciousness dissolves.

The tradition speaks of the 'wheel of energies' or 'Shakti Chakra,' which represents the collective totality of energies within the universe. By meditating on this wheel, practitioners aim to transcend the differentiated universe and experience the state of non-dualistic consciousness, where the external and internal become one.

Kashmiri Shaivism also delves into the concept of 'Svatantrya Shakti,' the supreme energy of Lord Shiva, which is characterized by absolute independence and awareness. This energy is both successive and non-successive, transcending the limitations of time and space, and is the source of all creation, protection, and destruction within the cosmos.
The human body, with its energy points, is thus seen as a vessel for the divine energy of Shiva. Through various practices, such as yogic breathing, concentration on chakras, and meditation, individuals can awaken and channel this dormant energy, leading to spiritual illumination and the recognition of one's true nature as part of the universal Consciousness.

In conclusion, Kashmiri Shaivism presents a rich tapestry of ideas that interweave the concepts of energy, the human body, and the universe. It offers a path to understanding the intricate relationship between the individual and the cosmic, highlighting the role of energy as the connecting thread in this spiritual journey.
